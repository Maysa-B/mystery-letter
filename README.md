## Mystery Letter
Bonus project (*not mandatory*) developed during block 05, in which I studied the _DOM tree, events, and JavaScript storage_.

### How it works
The most important features of this project are:
1. When typing a sentence in the `input` area, each word will receive a ___random___ style, and will appear on the screen as a mysterious message;
2. The number of words typed will always appear just below the `input` field;
3. When we click on any word of the mystery letter, a ___random___ style will be generated again for that word.
